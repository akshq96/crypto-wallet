# 🔐 Crypto Wallet Browser Extension

A lightweight browser-based crypto wallet extension built to explore how blockchain
transactions and balance queries can be performed directly from a browser extension.
This project focuses on core wallet mechanics such as sending assets, checking balances,
and interacting with blockchain RPC endpoints using a clean popup UI.
