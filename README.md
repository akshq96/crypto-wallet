# 🔐 Crypto Wallet Browser Extension

A lightweight browser-based crypto wallet extension built to explore how blockchain
transactions and balance queries can be performed directly from a browser extension.

This project focuses on core wallet mechanics such as sending assets, checking balances,
and interacting with blockchain RPC endpoints using a clean popup UI.

## ✨ Features

-  Send crypto assets to a wallet address
-  Check wallet balance instantly
-  View transaction details after execution
-  Runs as a browser extension popup
-  Direct blockchain interaction (no external wallet dependency)

## 🧠 Project Goal

This project was created to understand:

- How wallet logic works behind the scenes
- How browser extensions interact with blockchain networks
- How transactions are constructed, signed, and sent
- How RPC-based communication works in Web3

It is intended for **learning and experimentation**, not production use.
